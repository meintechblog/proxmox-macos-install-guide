# Install Path Chooser

Use this page to pick the best install path for your Proxmox 9 Intel host.

## Recommended path

- [INSTALL_TAHOE.md](INSTALL_TAHOE.md)
- Use this if you want the newest macOS generation available from Apple recovery (`-os latest`).
- This is the default recommendation for this project now.

## Compatibility fallback

- [INSTALL_VENTURA.md](INSTALL_VENTURA.md)
- Use this if latest/Tahoe path is unstable on your hardware.
- Ventura remains a strong fallback with predictable behavior.

## Which one should I start with?

1. Start with Tahoe/latest.
2. If you get recurring Apple-logo stalls, switch to Ventura fallback.
3. Keep VM snapshots before major updates in both paths.
